      h1 The Polygon Bridge Tool
      p.is-size-4 The Bridge tool is one of the most helpful functions in a 3D artistâ€™s arsenal. It is a hugely versatile tool that can create the foundations for a complex build, or produce curved and twisted geometry with a single click of the mouse.
      p.is-size-4 I used it while fixing the corrupt faces that arose from the (somewhat unreliable) boolean technique. I was forced to delete many faces with reversed normals and lamina (overlapping) faces and use the bridging tool to then fill those holes.
