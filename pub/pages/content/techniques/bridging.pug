    h1 The Polygon Bridge Tool
    section(style="padding:0 1rem 4rem")
      p.is-size-3 The Bridge tool is one of the most helpful functions in a 3D artistâ€™s arsenal. It is a hugely versatile tool that can create the foundations for a complex build, or produce curved and twisted geometry with a single click of the mouse.
      p.is-size-3 I used it while fixing the corrupt faces that arose from the unreliable boolean technique. I was forced to delete many faces with reversed normals and lamina (overlapping) faces.
